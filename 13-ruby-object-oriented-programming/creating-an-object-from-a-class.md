# Creating an Object from a Class
## Creating an Object from a Class
An object is created from a class using the new method. For example, to create an instance of our BankAccount class we simply perform the following:

account = BankAccount.new()
This creates a BankAccount object named account. Having created the object we can call our test_method:

account.test_method
The class is working
